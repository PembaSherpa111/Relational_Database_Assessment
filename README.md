## Introduction
The International Souvenirs Group (ISG) is a company that tracks souvenirs from throughout the world. They have their travelling groups catalog their souvenirs from their travels. ISG saves all of their souvenir details into a spreadsheet and exported the data for us in a CSV.

As the company has more groups to travel and more souvenirs to log, they realize that their spreadsheet isn't enough and that it's time to store it in a SQL Server database. They also know that it's a pain when they recategorize their souvenirs and have to touch each souvenir to update their category descriptions. Maintaining repetitive data is becoming a costly operation for their day-to-day work. You need to make sure their database is structured to minimize the repetition.

## Requirements
* Use the company's data to design a multi-table schema with appropriate relationships.
* Build a SQL DDL script to create the schema.
* Populate the database with sample data from a delimited data file. Save the DML SQL so it can be executed whenever needed.
* Write queries to confirm the sample is loaded properly.
